### What is this?

This is a collection of links to lots of lovely property and decorator drawers that can make your Unity life much more pleasant.

### Contributing
If you have a lovely drawer that you'd like to share, send me the details, or if you're really into this github thing, submit a pull request with your addition(s).

#### Why isn't this an actual database or something
I wanted to see if it was a worthwhile project in the firstplace, and Github.io seemed like a good way to try out the MVP.
